          A recording medium is a physical material that holds information.
          Newly created information is distributed and can be stored in four
          storage media–print, film, magnetic, and optical–and seen or heard in
          four information flows–telephone, radio and TV, and the Internet[4] as
          well as being observed directly. Digital information is stored on
          electronic media in many different recording formats. With electronic
          media, the data and the recording media are sometimes referred to as
          "software" despite the more common use of the word to describe
          computer software. With (traditional art) static media, art materials
          such as crayons may be considered both equipment and medium as the
          wax, charcoal or chalk material from the equipment becomes part of the
          surface of the medium. Some recording media may be temporary either by
          design or by nature. Volatile organic compounds may be used to
          preserve the environment or to purposely make data expire over time.
          Data such as smoke signals or skywriting are temporary by nature.
          Depending on the volatility, a gas (e.g. atmosphere, smoke) or a
          liquid surface such as a lake would be considered a temporary
          recording medium if at all.
